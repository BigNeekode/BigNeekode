## About

I focus on small, cozy game experiences: short, self-contained plays with warm visuals, gentle audio, and satisfying interaction. My toolset centers around Unity and C#, with a healthy curiosity for tooling, audio implementation, and fast iteration.

## What I'm Building & Learning
- 🍃 Micro-prototyping new ideas every week
- 🔧 Tools and editor scripts to speed up dev workflows
- 🎼 Composing and integrating ambient loops and sound FX

---

## Tech & Tools
- Unity (C#) — primary engine
- Git, GitHub — version control and hosting
- Blender — 3D modelling
- Reaper / FL Studio / Ableton — composing music
- VS Code and Rider — editors
